MOTO 02.
Note: When writing to a text file, be sure to use the correct line-ending character! Unix systems use \n, Windows systems use \r\n, and Macintosh systems use \r as the line ending character. Windows offers a translation flag ('t') which will translate \n to \r\n when working with the file. You can also use 'b' to force binary mode. To use these flags, specify either 'b' or 't' as the last character of the mode parameter.
